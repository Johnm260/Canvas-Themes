# Canvas-Themes
javascript code to change canvas colors since there is no in-app option at the moment.

you can run the script as a bookmarklet, or a tampermonkey script, but IMO tampermonkey is better since it automatically runs when opening the page.

if you want an updating version for it the tampermonkey and bookmarklets have their own auto-updating scripts.

Feel free to change it and reupload it, just make sure to give credit :)

latest update:

- added icon color support
- made icons work with rbg
- made all hrefs have CSS styles
- "Beautified" code, and removed excessive spaces

previous updates:

- added handling for saving RGB colors
- added new theme "RGB Lights"
- added GPA calculator (not weighted, list view only)
- more CSS styles for the calendar page (editing calendar dates)
