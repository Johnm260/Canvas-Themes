# Canvas-Themes
javascript code to change canvas colors since there is no in app option at the moment.

you can run the script as a bookmarklet, or a tameprmonkey script, but IMO tampermonkey is better since it automatically runs when opening the page.

if you want an updating version for it the tampermonkey and bookmarklets have their own auto-updating scripts.

Feel free to change it and reupload, just make sure to give credit :)
