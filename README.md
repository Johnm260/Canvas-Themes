# Canvas-Themes
i make canvas look color using css, because i hate my school and their dumb canvas theme

you can run the script as a bookmarklet, or a tameprmonkey script, but IMO tampermonkey is better since it automatically runs when opening the page.

if you want an updating version for it the tampermonkey and bookmarklets have their own auto-updating scripts.

latest update:
added handling for saving rgb colors
added new theme "RGB Lights"

previous updates:
i didnt write them down lmao
