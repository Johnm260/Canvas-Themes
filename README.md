# Canvas-Themes
i make canvas look color using css, because i hate my school and their ugly ass canvas theme

you can do using bookmarklet or tampermokey but tankmonkey better in my opinion because it auto-applies it

if you want an updating version for it the tampermonkey and bookmarklets have their own auto-updating scripts.

latest update:
added handling for saving rgb colors
added new theme "RGB Lights"

previous updates:
i didnt write them down lmao
